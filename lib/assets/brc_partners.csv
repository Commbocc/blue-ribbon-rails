That is at the core of what the Even Start Program is all about. Even Start is focused on offering opportunities for parents and their children aged six weeks to three  years. Many of these parents are seeking skills to provide a secure, nurturing environment with a strong start for their infants and toddlers. While parents study ESOL, earn their GEDs and take other adult education classes at the facility, their children are stimulated by a professional teaching staff that works to give them a leg-up when starting school. Parents attend two learning sessions with their children each week, where they read to the child and engage in play as directed by the child. In doing so, they learn to better understand each other and communicate their needs. It is also a powerful bonding time for parent and baby. In addition to class time, parents in school are able to spend lunch times with their babies. The Even Start Program takes place in the colorful UACDC nursery, which is adorned by caterpillar murals and many, many items to explore. Under the guidance of teaching professionals, children are encouraged to learn through play. At the same time, parents learn more about everything from nutrition to discipline—all in an accepting, nonjudgmental environment.

98,Family Treatment Program,"The Family Treatment Program (FTP) is a 5day intensive residential program for families with children six through twelve years old who are experiencing emotional and behavioral difficulties. Children in the FTP stay in a dormitory setting Monday through Friday, attend  school on campus, and return home each weekend and on holidays. The Program is operated cooperatively by the Department of Children's Services (DCS) and the public school system. The Dorothy Thomas School, a center-based school for children eligible for the EBD Program, is located on the campus. The Program is offered at no cost to our clients. PROGRAM PHILOSOPHY: The Department of Children's Services is dedicated to ensuring the best possible care and treatment for children and families. We are committed to protecting the health, safety and welfare of all children in our care, while providing a proactive, nurturing, therapeutic environment where all people are treated with dignity and respect. TREATMENT: Treatment for up to 24 children is designed to address the family's difficulties in social/emotional areas and  for the child in residence, academic areas. Each family is assigned to a treatment team which includes a counselor and child care specialist, a teacher, and an aide. The team develops an individual treatment plan for each family and for the child in residence. Supervision is provided by the Clinical Services Director, and a Clinical Psychologist. Children receive individual, group and family therapy, and if appropriate, play therapy. ADMISSION CRITERIA: The Family Treatment Program is designed to serve families with children who have been identified by the school system as eligible to receive services through the Emotionally Handicapped Program  (Full Time), and for whom a more restrictive placement may be indicated. Children being served in a less restrictive educational program (SLD, E H-Resource) are not eligible for consideration. (Exceptions to this rule may be made only if paperwork for a more restrictive placement is near completion.) Additional admission requirements are: the child must be a resident of Hillsborough County, 6 through 12 years of age, in good health with no severe cognitive impairment. Proof of a recent physical and dental exam must be submitted. The parents or  legal guardians must voluntarily agree to placement and be able and willing to participate in the treatment plan. Once enrolled in the FTP, if a child exceeds 12 years old, continued enrollment is possible if recommended by the treatment team (or ARD Committee). Children commonly referred to the FTP are currently eligible to receive services through the Emotionally Handicapped Special Class or Emotionally/Behaviorally Disturbed Program in the public school system. They may be exhibiting signs of difficulty in their present placement, family setting, and/or community setting. Some have a history of psychiatric hospitalization for stabilization,  or are currently receiving outpatient services. For some, Department of Children & Families (DCF) involvement may be extensive, however, there must be a secure home placement (with the parents, or in a foster care home) for weekends and holidays. Children commonly not accepted into the FTP, although the above characteristics may apply, are: those with an extensive legal history, a measured intellectual capacity within the Mentally Deficient Range, or those who have been diagnosed as psychotic, or are otherwise clearly in need of a psychiatric placement. FAMILY REVIEW AND DISCHARGE PLANNING: Each family's progress in the Family Treatment Program is reviewed regularly by the Acceptance, Review and Discharge (ARD) Committee. Review meetings address factors such as the child's behavioral and socialemotional adjustment, academic progress and parent participation. Parent participation is the most critical factor. Treatment plans are modified as needed. Every effort is made to encourage clients and their families to actively take part in the treatment plan. Discharge from the  program may occur as the result of successfully reaching treatment goals, or after a determination that the child/family has reached maximum gains following extensive treatment efforts. Once discharge from the program is indicated, steps are taken to ease the transition back into the home setting on a fulltime basis. At that time, services within the community may be accessed to provide for continued medication management and/or outpatient treatment, if indicated. If a family's treatment goals have not been adequately reached, every effort is made to refer them to additional services within the community. R E-REFERRAL: The Department of Children's Services staff provides extensive efforts both in screening for potential clients and in developing appropriate treatment plans for participating clients and their families. Program staff respectfully acknowledge their strengths and their limitations regarding the treatment of clients whose needs exceed the parameters of the 5-Day Family Treatment Program. Consequently, it is unlikely that a client may be re-referred to the program, following a carefully planned discharge. In cases where clients who have been discharged from the program present with recurring behavioral and/or social-emotional difficulties, a referral for a more restrictive placement may be indicated. REFERRAL PROCEDURES: The referral must be processed in conjunction with an agent, typically the School Social Worker from the child's current school. Pre-referral tours of the Program are necessary. The child is seen by Clinical Services personnel for further assessment of his/her mental, physical, social, emotional, educational, and intellectual status. The case is then scheduled for consideration by the Acceptance, Review and Discharge (ARD) Committee which must be attended by the referral agent and the parent or legal guardian. The ARD Committee makes specific recommendations regarding the conditions of acceptance. Acceptance for all clients who enter the program is considered conditional pending a review of the child's overall adjustment and the extent of compliance with program guidelines and participation in family therapy.INFORMATION REQUESTS: All inquiries should be directed to the Clinical Services Secretary, Department of Children's Services, 3110 Clay Mangum Lane, Tampa, FL 33618, Telephone (813) 264-3807, Ext. 130, 813-264-3807, 3110 Clay Magnum Lane, Tampa, FL, 33618-2501Children ages 7-12 who have been identified by the school system as eligible to receive services through the Emotionally Handicapped Program (Full Time), and for whom a more restrictive placement may be indicated","3110 Clay Magnum Lane, Tampa, FL, 33618",28.07119,-82.494255,http://localhost:3000/blue_ribbon/partners/98.json

143,Kimmins Family Learning Center,"Kimmins Family Learning Center is a community based Even Start family literacy program. The program follows the National Center for Family Literacy Kenan model which is comprehensive, holistic, and family focused in its approach to empower families. The program operates twelve months a year and delivers intensity of services. Low-income at-risk families are the population served. Parents who need to complete their education or to become English proficient attend the adult education program bringing their children to school with them. Their children who are between the ages of six months to five years participate in a developmental program to establish school readiness skills. Parents attend parenting classes, parent support group, and participate in parent and children together literacy activities. Literacy is transmitted into the home through monthly home literacy activities, which involve the whole family. To support families in becoming self-sufficient, personal growth classes, workforce development training, and career counseling are a major program focus. In summary, the family literacy program works to develop the potential of families . . . parents and children . . .to transition families out of poverty, dependency, and the dead-end working poor class. Family literacy programs can be described as effective welfare reform program. The Even Start Family Literacy program is in  tune with the movement in doing something different. The difference is the shift of focus from child to the family. >First, parents who need to complete their basic education and/or learn English participate in the adult educational program to earn their G.E.D. and/or to become English proficient. These parents have children between six months to five years of age, and need child care in order to study. In today's society, a great number of parents trying to support a family often lack the completion of a basic education, English proficiency, and job/career training. >Second, children attend a developmental program while their parents are in the adult education program. You may be asking what is the difference between child care and a developmental program? The difference between the two can make a great difference in the lives of children! Child care is basically taking care of the physical needs of the child, and a developmental program is focused on the intellectual, language, social, emotional, and physical needs of the child. Children who participate in a developmental program are more likely to gain early learning experiences which establish a foundation for all other learning to build upon. Children experiencing school failures often lack the foundation of key learning experiences.>Third, parents and children participate in structured learning activities together. In a family literacy program, parents and children come to school together to learn. P.A.C.T. Time (parents and children together time) is the key ingredient in a family literacy program. Parents become involved parents…involved in the learning process of their children. Parents observe their children to identify what they have learned, understand what they will learn next, and are able to offer the key learning experiences needed to help their child achieve the next developmental task. >Fourth, parents participate in parent education classes. In today's world, parenting is not an easy task…parents need all the support they can get. The stresses of life and the socialchanges are much greater today for families than ever before. The formal education classes, just to name a few topics, teach parents about the different parenting styles, how children learn, child development, and effective child management skills. They also get a chance to vent and discuss issues in weekly parent support group sessions. Parents get one-to-one counseling with a counseling psychologist when requested and can also seek assistance from a family advocate who is also on staff. >Fifth, parents are involved in workforce development activities to learn about career planning. They explore the many post educational opportunities available such as vocational schools, technical schools, community colleges, and universities. The goal for the family literacy families is to become self-sufficient, out of poverty, and out of the working class level of existence, and able to meet the needs of their family. ESOL, GED, ABE.
